This is a work-in-progress compiler for the [Cool programming language](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/software/cool/cool-manual.pdf).

The lexical analyzer is in [cool.flex](https://github.com/davejachimiak/cool_compiler/blob/master/cool.flex).
It's implemented with [Flex](http://flex.sourceforge.net/manual/), a c++ implementation of [Lex](http://dinosaur.compilertools.net/lex/).
